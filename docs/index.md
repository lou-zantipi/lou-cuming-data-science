# Lou Cuming

I am a data science grad at Commonwealth Bank. After a career as a professional trombonist and music industry professional, I took the bold leap, went back to uni and studied a masters degree and mpw have embarked on a new career in technology. I love learning, building, technology, challenging the status quo and connecting with people.
